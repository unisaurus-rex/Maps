Setup Notes:
For development, in index.html, the system.js file must be loaded before config.js

Dependencies:
bootstrap-sass does not list jquery as a dependency so you need to manually list it in startup.js

Installation after downloading project files:
- run npm install first, then run jspm install
- any package that is needed for front end code should be installed by jspm
  + this is because jspm builds a registry in config.js that system.js uses to reference packages
    when they're imported in a file
- any package only needed as a build tool or backed resource should be installed by npm
